Update 13-Jan

Finished UI. Began script work. Set up all the DOM objects I'll need as const's and tried to add event listener and function for the "1" button, but it's not working even though the code (to me) looks perfectly fine.


Update 15-Jan

Added button functionality for all except negative and decimal.
